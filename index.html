        <h3>Trump Proposes 25% Tariff on Foreign Cars Owned by Americans</h3>
        <p><em>By Alora Ignanco • April 18, 2025 • Washington, D.C.</em></p>
        <p>
          President Donald Trump has announced a sweeping and highly controversial new trade measure: a 25% tariff on all
          foreign-manufactured vehicles imported into the United States during President Joe Biden’s term in office — and
          in a stunning twist, the tariff will be paid by the current owner of the vehicle, not the importer or dealership.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trump claimed the move is necessary to "reverse the damage done to American industry by Biden's open-door trade policies."
        </p>
        <p>
          "If you’re driving a foreign car that came in during the Biden years, you’re going to pay the price," Trump said.
          "We’re done letting other countries take advantage of us — and that starts today."
        </p>

        <h4>Tariff Retroactive and Personal</h4>
        <p>
          The tariff applies to any foreign-made vehicle imported between January 20, 2021 and January 20, 2025,
          regardless of whether it has since changed hands. Under the policy, whoever currently owns the vehicle
          will be responsible for paying the 25% tax based on the car's original MSRP.
        </p>
        <p>
          The measure affects millions of drivers nationwide and has sparked immediate backlash from consumer groups
          and legal experts.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This is unlike anything we’ve seen before — retroactive taxation applied to private citizens for legally
          purchased goods,” said Maya Raines, a senior legal analyst at the Brookings Institution. “It will face
          enormous constitutional and logistical challenges.”
        </p>

        <h4>Chaos for Consumers and Dealers</h4>
        <p>
          Dealerships, local DMVs, and customs offices have been overwhelmed with questions from vehicle owners
          unsure how — or if — they’re supposed to comply.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I have customers calling in panic, asking if they’re supposed to write a check to the government for
          $9,000 because they bought a 2022 Subaru,” said Lisa Hayworth, a dealership manager in Denver.
          “We don’t even know what to tell them.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The Trump team has proposed using DMV records and VIN tracking to notify owners, and has suggested
          penalties for non-payment could include registration holds, fines, or liens.
        </p>

        <h4>Trump Defiant</h4>
        <p>
          Despite the outrage, Trump was unmoved.
        </p>
        <p>
          “These cars should never have been here in the first place,” he said. “Now their owners can help rebuild
          American manufacturing — and they’ll thank me later.”

        <h3>St. Louis Declares Toasted Ravioli a National Treasure</h3>
        <p><em>April 18, 2025 • St. Louis, MO</em></p>
        <p>
          In a surprising bipartisan vote, city officials passed a resolution today
          recognizing toasted ravioli as a cultural artifact worthy of federal protection.
          Supporters say this is a crucial step toward preserving Midwestern identity.
