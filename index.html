        <h3>Trump Proposes 25% Tariff on Foreign Cars Owned by Americans</h3>
        <p><em>By Alora Ignanco • April 18, 2025 • Washington, D.C.</em></p>
        <p>
          President Donald Trump has announced a sweeping and highly controversial new trade measure:
          a 25% tariff on all foreign-manufactured vehicles imported during President Joe Biden’s term —
          and the kicker: the current owners will foot the bill.
        </p>
        <p>
          “If you’re driving a foreign car that came in during the Biden years, you’re going to pay the price,” Trump said.
          “We’re done letting other countries take advantage of us — and that starts today.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The tariff applies retroactively to any foreign vehicle imported between January 20, 2021 and January 20, 2025,
          regardless of ownership changes. Owners would pay based on the car’s original MSRP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consumer groups and legal experts are calling the move unprecedented. “It will face enormous constitutional and logistical challenges,” said Maya Raines, a legal analyst.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dealerships and DMVs are overwhelmed as owners panic over compliance. Trump remains defiant:
          “These cars should never have been here. Now their owners can help rebuild American manufacturing.”

        <h3>St. Louis Declares Toasted Ravioli a National Treasure</h3>
        <p><em>April 18, 2025 • St. Louis, MO</em></p>
        <p>
          In a surprising bipartisan vote, city officials passed a resolution today
          recognizing toasted ravioli as a cultural artifact worthy of federal protection.
          Supporters say this is a crucial step toward preserving Midwestern identity.
